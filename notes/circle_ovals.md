```text
let us say in my pdf, I have some ovals in my pdf, inside that ovals, some content is there. 
also some circles are existed, inside circles some content, 
some times the content is plain text and some times it can be even symbols like half circle or half square or some kind of symbols. 
might be a different font not sure about pdf. so I need to extract content inside that circles and ovals. is it possible.
the circles are not placed in fixed location of page. but circles are of almost same size mostly. 
```

Thanks for the detailed explanation‚Äîthat helps a lot. Based on what you've described, **yes, it's possible** to extract content from **inside ovals or circles** in a PDF using **PyMuPDF**, but there are some nuances and steps involved:

---

### ‚úÖ **What You Can Do**

You can use **PyMuPDF** to:

1. **Extract all text blocks and their positions** (bounding boxes).
2. **Identify which blocks fall inside a circular or oval region**.
3. **Optionally detect vector shapes** like circles/ovals if they‚Äôre stored as drawing instructions (lines, curves).
4. **Handle special symbols**‚Äîthough you might need to identify fonts or use unicode handling for non-text glyphs.

---

### üîç **How It Works Conceptually**

1. **Parse all shapes and text spans** on a page.
2. **Identify the bounding boxes of circles/ovals** (if extractable as shapes).
3. **For each shape**, check which text elements' centers fall **inside the ellipse/circle boundary**.
4. **Group and return the text** found within each shape.

### üß™ **Step-by-Step Sample Code**

This code assumes you can visually or heuristically identify circle/oval **positions** (e.g., fixed radius or bounding boxes), and then match text inside:

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
import math

def is_point_inside_ellipse(x, y, bbox):
    """Check if a point (x, y) is inside an elliptical bounding box."""
    x0, y0, x1, y1 = bbox
    cx, cy = (x0 + x1) / 2, (y0 + y1) / 2
    rx, ry = (x1 - x0) / 2, (y1 - y0) / 2
    return ((x - cx) ** 2) / (rx ** 2) + ((y - cy) ** 2) / (ry ** 2) <= 1

def extract_text_in_shapes(pdf_path, shape_bboxes):
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    results = []

    for page in doc:
        page_results = []
        text_blocks = page.get_text("dict")["blocks"]
        
        for bbox in shape_bboxes:
            collected_text = ""
            for block in text_blocks:
                if block["type"] == 0:  # Text block
                    for line in block["lines"]:
                        for span in line["spans"]:
                            x, y = span["bbox"][0], span["bbox"][1]  # top-left
                            mid_x = (span["bbox"][0] + span["bbox"][2]) / 2
                            mid_y = (span["bbox"][1] + span["bbox"][3]) / 2
                            if is_point_inside_ellipse(mid_x, mid_y, bbox):
                                collected_text += span["text"] + " "
            if collected_text:
                page_results.append(collected_text.strip())
        results.append(page_results)
    
    return results

# Sample usage with hypothetical circular/oval bounding boxes
pdf_file = "your_file.pdf"
# Example bounding boxes for oval regions (x0, y0, x1, y1)
shape_bounding_boxes = [
    (100, 150, 200, 250),  # Oval 1
    (300, 400, 400, 500),  # Oval 2
    # Add more as needed
]

extracted_text = extract_text_in_shapes(pdf_file, shape_bounding_boxes)
for i, page_texts in enumerate(extracted_text):
    print(f"Page {i + 1}:")
    for content in page_texts:
        print(f" - {content}")
```

### ü§ñ If You Don't Know the Circle Positions

If the **ovals/circles are vector shapes**, PyMuPDF *might* expose them through `page.get_drawings()`:

```python
shapes = page.get_drawings()
for shape in shapes:
    if shape["type"] == "curve":  # Often ovals are curves
        print(shape["rect"], shape["items"])
```

But this is limited‚Äîyou‚Äôd need to interpret the shapes heuristically (e.g., circular curves with similar width/height).

For **automated detection** of circles, you may need to:

* Render the PDF to an image (e.g., with PyMuPDF or pdf2image).
* Use **OpenCV** to detect circular shapes (`cv2.HoughCircles()`).
* Map the image coordinates back to PDF coordinates.

---

### üß† Special Symbols & Fonts

Some symbols (like half-circles, boxes, etc.) may:

* Appear as special Unicode characters.
* Be drawn as vector paths, not text.
* Use custom fonts or glyphs.

In such cases:

* Inspect span `["font"]` and `["text"]` in the output.
* Consider exporting spans with `get_text("dict")` and checking for non-ASCII or symbolic glyphs.
* Use OCR (e.g., Tesseract) on rendered images as fallback.

---

### üîö Summary

* ‚úÖ Yes, extracting text inside circular/oval shapes is feasible.
* üõ† You'll need to:

  * Detect those shapes (either manually, from drawings, or with computer vision).
  * Check which text blocks fall inside them.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Special symbols may require extra font decoding or OCR.
