Yes, absolutely ‚Äî even **without converting the PDF to an image and using OpenCV**, you can still extract a **significant amount of content directly** using **PyMuPDF** alone.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what **you can still do directly** with PyMuPDF:

---

## ‚úÖ What *Can* Be Extracted Directly

### 1. **Text Content**

* PyMuPDF (`page.get_text("dict")`) gives:

  * Words, lines, blocks
  * Bounding boxes for each span of text
* You can check **if text falls inside known regions** (like where you expect circles or rectangles).

### 2. **Text Formatting Info**

* Fonts, size, color, encoding, and even some special Unicode glyphs (like symbols).
* Helpful to distinguish between regular text and symbolic fonts.

### 3. **Annotations (if any)**

* If the document has annotations (highlighted or popup-style), those can be extracted with `.annots()`.

### 4. **Drawings / Shapes**

* You can access vector drawing instructions (e.g., lines, curves, circles) using `page.get_drawings()`.

---

## ‚ùå What You *Can‚Äôt Easily* Detect Without OpenCV

### 1. **Implicit Shapes**

* If the circles/ovals are **pure vector graphics without metadata**, PyMuPDF may return them as raw paths ‚Äî not labeled as ‚Äúthis is a circle.‚Äù
* You'll see something like:

  ```python
  [{'type': 'curve', 'items': [...], 'rect': (x0, y0, x1, y1)}]
  ```

  but you‚Äôll have to **manually analyze path items** to know if it‚Äôs a circle or oval.

### 2. **Symbols as Vector Paths**

* If symbols (like half-squares) are **not real text**, but vector paths or embedded fonts, PyMuPDF won't extract them as readable characters unless the font is properly embedded and readable.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Direct Approach (Without OpenCV)

Here‚Äôs what you can still do effectively:

1. **Extract all text blocks**
2. **Use heuristics** (e.g. ‚Äúif text block is small and positioned similarly to where I expect a circle, capture it‚Äù)
3. **Optionally filter by font or symbols**

### ‚úÖ Example (no OpenCV):

```python
import fitz

def extract_candidate_text_blocks(pdf_path):
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    all_blocks = []

    for page_num in range(len(doc)):
        page = doc.load_page(page_num)
        text_dict = page.get_text("dict")

        for block in text_dict["blocks"]:
            if block["type"] == 0:
                for line in block["lines"]:
                    for span in line["spans"]:
                        text = span["text"]
                        bbox = span["bbox"]
                        font = span["font"]
                        size = span["size"]

                        # Filter: small text blocks could be inside circles
                        if len(text.strip()) <= 5 and 6 < size < 15:
                            all_blocks.append({
                                "page": page_num + 1,
                                "text": text,
                                "bbox": bbox,
                                "font": font,
                                "size": size,
                            })
    return all_blocks

results = extract_candidate_text_blocks("your_file.pdf")
for item in results:
    print(f"[Page {item['page']}] {item['text']} at {item['bbox']} (font: {item['font']})")
```

### üîç Tip:

You can add logic like:

* **Check if the `bbox` is roughly square** (might be a symbol inside a circle).
* **Check font name** ‚Äî sometimes symbolic fonts have custom names like `Wingdings`, `Symbol`, or `CustomFont123`.

---

### üîö Summary

‚úîÔ∏è You *can still extract content* directly without OpenCV.
‚úîÔ∏è Text (and sometimes even symbolic glyphs) can be pulled using `get_text("dict")`.
üö´ You won‚Äôt get shape detection (like detecting circles) unless:

* You define shape positions yourself
* Or use shape metadata (if available)

Would you like help writing logic to **auto-detect square-ish text boxes** as a proxy for symbols inside circles?
