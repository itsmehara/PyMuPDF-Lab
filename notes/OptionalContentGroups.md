Let's delve deeper into extracting layered content from your AutoCAD-generated PDFs using PyMuPDF. AutoCAD PDFs often utilize Optional Content Groups (OCGs), which allow for the inclusion of multiple layers within a single PDF. These layers can represent different sets of information, such as dimensions, annotations, or different language versions. PyMuPDF provides tools to interact with these layers effectively.([GitHub][1])

## 🔍 Understanding Optional Content Groups (OCGs)

OCGs, also known as layers, are a feature in PDFs that enable content to be grouped and optionally displayed or hidden. Each OCG has a visibility state and can be toggled on or off. In AutoCAD PDFs, these layers might correspond to different types of content, like annotations, dimensions, or background graphics.([Artifex][2])

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Guide to Extract Layered Content

### 1. **Check for Available Layers**

First, determine if your PDF contains any OCGs:

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

# Open the PDF
doc = fitz.open("your_autocad_file.pdf")

# Retrieve the layer UI configurations
layer_configs = doc.layer_ui_configs()

# Check if there are any layers
if not layer_configs:
    print("No layers found in this PDF.")
else:
    print(f"Found {len(layer_configs)} layers:")
    for layer in layer_configs:
        print(f"Layer: {layer['text']}, Visible: {layer['on']}")
```



This script will list all available layers and their current visibility states.([Artifex][2])

### 2. **Toggle Layer Visibility**

To extract content from a specific layer, you can toggle its visibility:([Artifex][2])

```python
# Turn off the 'english' layer (replace with your layer's name)
doc.set_layer_ui_config(1, action=2)  # action=2 sets the layer to OFF

# Extract text from the page
page = doc.load_page(0)  # Load the first page
text = page.get_text("text")
print(text)
```



This will extract text from the first page with the 'english' layer turned off. Adjust the layer number as needed.([Artifex][2])

### 3. **Extract Annotations by Layer**

Annotations in PDFs can also be associated with specific layers. To extract annotations by their associated layer:([Stack Overflow][3])

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Initialize a dictionary to store annotations by layer
annotations_by_layer = defaultdict(list)

# Iterate through each page
for page_num in range(len(doc)):
    page = doc.load_page(page_num)
    for annot in page.annots():
        # Get the layer (OCG) associated with the annotation
        ocg_xref = annot.get_oc()
        if ocg_xref > 0:
            ocg_dict = doc.get_ocgs()[ocg_xref]
            layer_name = ocg_dict["name"]
            annotations_by_layer[layer_name].append(annot.rect)

# Print annotations grouped by layer
for layer, annotations in annotations_by_layer.items():
    print(f"Layer: {layer}, Annotations: {annotations}")
```



This script groups annotations by their associated layer and prints their bounding boxes.

## 🧠 Tips for Working with Layers in AutoCAD PDFs

* **Layer Visibility**: Use `doc.layer_ui_configs()` to inspect and manage layer visibility.
* **Layer-Specific Extraction**: Toggle layers on or off using `doc.set_layer_ui_config()` to extract content specific to a layer.
* **Annotations**: Annotations can be associated with specific layers. Use `annot.get_oc()` to retrieve the OCG (Optional Content Group) associated with an annotation.
* **Performance**: Be mindful of performance when dealing with large PDFs or numerous layers. Consider processing pages in batches or using asynchronous methods if available.([Artifex][2], [Stack Overflow][3])
