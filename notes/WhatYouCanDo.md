PyMuPDF (also known as `fitz`) is a powerful Python library for working with PDF files. It allows you to extract text, images, and metadata, as well as manipulate and analyze the content of PDFs. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex documents like AutoCAD-generated PDFs, which may include vector graphics, annotations, and layered content.([devgem.io][1])

## ðŸ”§ What You Can Do with PyMuPDF

### 1. **Extract Text**

You can extract text from PDF pages in various formats:([Artifex][2])

* **Plain Text**: Extracts raw text without any formatting.
* **Blocks**: Returns text as blocks, useful for structured documents.
* **HTML**: Extracts text with basic HTML formatting.
* **JSON**: Provides detailed information about the text layout.([CodeEase][3])

For example, to extract plain text:

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

doc = fitz.open("your_file.pdf")
for page in doc:
    text = page.get_text("text")
    print(text)
```



This will print the extracted text from each page.

### 2. **Extract Images**

You can extract images embedded in the PDF:

```python
import fitz

doc = fitz.open("your_file.pdf")
for page_num in range(len(doc)):
    page = doc.load_page(page_num)
    image_list = page.get_images(full=True)
    for img_index, img in enumerate(image_list):
        xref = img[0]
        base_image = doc.extract_image(xref)
        image_bytes = base_image["image"]
        with open(f"image{page_num + 1}_{img_index + 1}.png", "wb") as img_file:
            img_file.write(image_bytes)
```



This script saves each image as a PNG file.

### 3. **Extract Metadata**

Retrieve metadata such as author, title, and creation date:([etutorialspoint.com][4])

```python
import fitz

doc = fitz.open("your_file.pdf")
metadata = doc.metadata
print(metadata)
```



This will print the metadata of the PDF.

### 4. **Extract Tables**

PyMuPDF can identify and extract tables from PDFs:([Artifex][2])

```python
import fitz

doc = fitz.open("your_file.pdf")
for page in doc:
    blocks = page.get_text("dict")["blocks"]
    for b in blocks:
        if b["type"] == 0:  # Text block
            print(b["text"])
```



This example prints text blocks, which can be further processed to identify tables.

### 5. **Extract Layout Information**

For more detailed analysis, you can extract layout information:

```python
import fitz

doc = fitz.open("your_file.pdf")
for page in doc:
    blocks = page.get_text("dict")["blocks"]
    for b in blocks:
        if b["type"] == 0:  # Text block
            for line in b["lines"]:
                for span in line["spans"]:
                    print(f"Text: {span['text']}, Font: {span['font']}, Size: {span['size']}")
```



This provides detailed information about each text span, including font and size.([Medium][5])

## ðŸ§­ PyMuPDF Documentation Highlights

The PyMuPDF tutorial provides comprehensive guidance on:

* **Opening and Navigating PDFs**: Learn how to open PDF files and navigate through pages.
* **Extracting Text and Images**: Detailed methods for extracting text and images from PDFs.
* **Working with Metadata**: Accessing and manipulating PDF metadata.
* **Modifying PDFs**: Techniques for editing and creating PDFs.
* **Advanced Features**: Utilizing PyMuPDF's advanced features for complex PDF manipulation.

For AutoCAD PDFs, which may contain vector graphics and annotations, PyMuPDF's ability to handle complex layouts and extract detailed information makes it a suitable choice. You can use the `get_text("dict")` method to analyze the structure of the document and extract relevant content.([Welcome to python-forum.io][6])

## âœ… Sample Workflow for AutoCAD PDFs

Here's a sample workflow to extract and process content from an AutoCAD-generated PDF:

```python
import fitz

doc = fitz.open("your_autocad_file.pdf")
for page_num in range(len(doc)):
    page = doc.load_page(page_num)
    blocks = page.get_text("dict")["blocks"]
    for b in blocks:
        if b["type"] == 0:  # Text block
            print(f"Page {page_num + 1}: {b['text']}")
        elif b["type"] == 1:  # Image block
            xref = b["image"]
            base_image = doc.extract_image(xref)
            image_bytes = base_image["image"]
            with open(f"image{page_num + 1}.png", "wb") as img_file:
                img_file.write(image_bytes)
```



This script processes each page, extracting text and images, and saves the images as PNG files.

## ðŸ§ª Tips for Handling AutoCAD PDFs

* **Layered Content**: AutoCAD PDFs may have layered content. Use PyMuPDF's `get_text("dict")` method to analyze and extract specific layers.
* **Vector Graphics**: For vector graphics, PyMuPDF's image extraction capabilities can be utilized, though handling complex vector data may require additional processing.
* **Annotations**: Annotations such as dimensions and notes can be extracted using the `get_text("dict")` method, which provides detailed information about text spans.([Welcome to python-forum.io][6])
